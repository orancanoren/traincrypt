<h4>Privacy-preserving Machine Learning using Homomorphic Encryption</h4>
</center>

Traincrypt aims to implement and (perhaps in the near future) create an API for easy development of privacy preserving machine learning techniques. Currently, linear regression is implemented over the Paillier cipher.

Source code is written in Jupyter Notebook format. You may view the source from [here](traincrypt).

### Used APIs

- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
- [python-paillier](https://github.com/n1analytics/python-paillier)
- [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
